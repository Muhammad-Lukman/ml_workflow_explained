#  ML Workflow Explained (Beginner Friendly)

This repository provides a step-by-step explanation of a **complete machine learning workflow** using the classic **Iris flower dataset**. It is designed for beginners and intermediate learners who want a clean, practical, and well-documented example of how machine learning projects are structured and executed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

##  Dataset

The project uses the **Iris flower dataset**, a well-known multi-class classification problem. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species, with four features per sample:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The dataset is loaded directly from **scikit-learn**, so no manual download is required.

##  Workflow Overview

The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

1. Problem Understanding  
   - Classification of iris species based on flower measurements.

2. Data Loading  
   - Loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris`.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Summary statistics, data visualization, pair plots.

4. Data Cleaning  
   - Duplicate handling, structure inspection.

5. Preprocessing  
   - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.

6. Modeling  
   - Logistic Regression using `scikit-learn`.

7. Model Evaluation  
   - Accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report.
